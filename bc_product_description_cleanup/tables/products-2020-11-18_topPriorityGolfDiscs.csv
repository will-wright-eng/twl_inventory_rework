Product,8240,"Discmania Link (Glow Lumen Hard) Medusa Halloween 2020 Special Edition",P,130DMXX,,Discmania,"Lumen Link Options",Right,"<p><span>The Link has a stable flight for a putter, able to take large amounts of spin without getting floaty and able to glide to the basket without fading out too soon. The Link fits the perfect all around putter for beginners and seasoned pros alike. This putter features a big bead on the rim that makes the Link feel comfortable and helps it glide out of the hand easily on every shot. The Link is slightly shorter than the P2 while not being short enough to qualify as low profile. Anyone who&rsquo;s a fan of the P2 but looking for a smaller grip will find an immediate comfort in the Link. The Link has a straight flight when thrown, resulting in a putter that can be relied upon for any up shot needed on the green. Attack the basket head on, or adjust the angle of release and have a putter that can crush any hyzer or anhyzer line with enough glide to carry clear down the fairway.</span></p> <p><span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Link up your putting game just in time for glow season and cooler temperatures. The fan favorite Exo Lumen Link is now available for a limited time only.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p>The Link has a stable, reliable flight for a putter. You can count on it to handle a pretty decent amount of snap before wanting to turn over. It has a slightly shallower feel and profile compared to the P2, making it a great option for just about anyone and especially those that find the P2 to be too deep in hand.</p> <p>Lumen plastic adds some specialty flare to your favorite putter. You can expect the grip of this plastic to be just as good as our traditional Soft or Hard Exo plastics but will glow in the dark when exposed to natural or artificial light.</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pro Tip: </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Hard Lumen plastic gives the Link enough rigidity for players to be confident that the disc will retain its shape, even for players with a firm grip.

By far the most popular of the new active line releases from Dsicmania. This putter has a neutral flight with a slight fade at the end, that helps guarantee a strong connection with the chains and keeping putting flight consistent. The SENSEI also doubles as a great approach disc. When thrown from further out the SENSEI sails straight with little to no fade, making this disc perfect for all types of approach shots. The addition of the ""Premium"" plastic to this lineup is bonus for the Active line lovers. The grip on this champion like plastic is supreme. <br /></span></span></span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>Please note: disc and stamp colors may vary from images shown.</em></span></span></span></p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Discmania Active Baseline plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-3.gif"" alt=""speed-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-3.gif"" alt=""glide-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></p> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-1.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-1.gif"" alt=""fade-1.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Putter</li> <li>Best Choice for: All around putter</li> <li>Assorted weights between 165-170g</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",15.99,7.05,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.4000,8.2500,0.5000,8.2500,Y,Y,"Ships in 1-2 Days","by option",7,0,"Disc Golf/Discs/Putter & Approach",42873,n/814/DSC03398__60259.JPG,,Y,0,42874,l/345/DSC03403__72549.JPG,,N,1,42875,j/643/DSC03409__55495.JPG,,N,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",,N,/disc-golf/discs/putter-approach/discmania-active-sensei-premium/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=3;Glide=3;Turn=0;Fade=1;""Plastic Class=Basic"""

Product,8299,"Innova Teebird (Star) Stock Model",P,302ICDXX,,"Innova Disc Golf","Disc Golf - Stock Models",Right,"<p>The TeeBird is a very accurate and reliable fairway disc golf driver. It has a combination of straight flight, high glide and good speed that make it accurate and long flying both upwind and downwind. It is a popular choice not just for it's namesake and 2009 World Champion Avery Jenkins but for many other pros including 12-time World Champion and Hall-of-Famer Ken Climo. It is very versatile disc golf driver: excellent for pin-point accuracy, distance and sidearm. We recommend this driver to the player that wants more distance than a mid-range disc but not as much as a high-speed driver.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's Star plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-7.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-7.gif"" alt=""speed-7.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif"" alt=""fade-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Fairway Drivers</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Accurate fairway drives, utility driver, flex shots</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",16.99,8.05,0.00,0.00,0.0000,N,,0.5000,8.2500,0.5000,8.2500,Y,Y,"Ships in 1-2 Days","by option",12,0,"Disc Golf/Discs/Fairway Driver",43227,o/771/DSC04828__87528.JPG,,Y,0,43228,h/621/DSC04839__37973.JPG,,N,1,43229,p/517/DSC04844__01955.JPG,,N,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0,"Default Tax Class",,N,/disc-golf/discs/fairway-driver/innova-teebird-star-stock-model/,,,301,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=7;Glide=5;Turn=0;Fade=2;""Plastic Class=Premium"""
