The Beast was an instant classic when it was released; giving players more distance using less power. The Beast&rsquo;s high glide, high speed and high speed turn all combine to give big distance. It is suitable for beginners and pros alike. The Champion Beast is endorsed by two-time World Champion Barry Schultz. We recommend this disc for players who like the Valkyrie but want more distance.</p> <p>Information about <a title=\"Information about this plastic type\" href=\"https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/\">Innova's Champion plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=\"__mce_add_custom__\" title=\"speed-10.gif\" src=\"https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-10.gif\" alt=\"speed-10.gif\" width=\"70\" height=\"62\" /><img class=\"__mce_add_custom__\" title=\"glide-5.gif\" src=\"https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif\" alt=\"glide-5.gif\" width=\"70\" height=\"62\" /></div> <p><img class=\"__mce_add_custom__\" title=\"turn-minus-2.gif\" src=\"https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-2.gif\" alt=\"turn-minus-2.gif\" width=\"70\" height=\"62\" /><img class=\"__mce_add_custom__\" title=\"fade-2.gif\" src=\"https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif\" alt=\"fade-2.gif\" width=\"70\" height=\"62\" /><br /><a title=\"About the flight characteristics numbering system\" href=\"https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/\">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Long Distance Drivers</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Turnover distance driver, tailwind driver, novice players looking for more distance</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=\"Wright Life staff picks\" href=\"https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/\">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=\"Learn why discs fly the way they do\" href=\"https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/\">Learn about the \"Nature of Disc Flight\"</a></p>'''\n",
