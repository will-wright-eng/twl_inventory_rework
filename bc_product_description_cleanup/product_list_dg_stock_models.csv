We recommend this driver to the player that wants more distance than a mid-range disc but not as much as a high-speed driver.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's Champion plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-7.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-7.gif"" alt=""speed-7.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif"" alt=""fade-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Fairway Drivers</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Accurate fairway drives, utility driver, flex shots</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",15.99,7.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,10.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Fairway Driver,,,,,323.0,j/751/icd_champteebird__18566.jpg,,N,0.0,396.0,z/811/icd_champteebird__32292.jpg,,Y,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/discs/fairway-driver/innova-teebird-champion/,,,3904,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=7;Glide=5;Turn=0;Fade=2;""Plastic Class=Candy"""

For longer approaches, it has a slow predictable turn and likes to land flat for very few roll-aways. This disc is very beginner friendly. We recommend this disc to the player looking to make the transition from catch discs to golf discs.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's DX plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-1.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-1.gif"" alt=""speed-1.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-2.gif"" alt=""glide-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-4.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-0.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-0.gif"" alt=""fade-0.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Putter</li> <li>Diameter: 21.6cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Beginners, short to medium approaches, putting</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",8.99,3.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,N,N,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,1.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Midrange,,,,,755.0,r/569/icd_dxsonic__58774.jpg,,Y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/innova-dx-sonic/,,,591,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=1;Glide=2;Turn=-4;Fade=0;""Plastic Class=Basic"""

If there is too much wind for the Axis to get the job done, the Vector is a great choice.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">MVP Neutron Plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-5.gif"" alt=""speed-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /> <img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-4.gif"" alt=""glide-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /> <img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif"" alt=""fade-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Mid-range</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Headwind approaches, mid-range flex shots, hyzers</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",18.99,8.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,2.0,0.0,"Disc Golf/Discs/Midrange;Disc Golf/Discs/Unique, PFN & OOP/Out of Production",,,,,1003.0,r/941/mvp_neutronVector__11666.jpg,,Y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/discs/midrange/mvp-vector-neutron-oop/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=5;Glide=4;Turn=0;Fade=2;""Plastic Class=Premium"""

Picture Innova&rsquo;s Xcaliber with a little more speed and stability and you&rsquo;ll know what this disc is like. It is abnormally fast for the stability it offers.

Product,554,Innova KC PRO ROC,P,1111,,Innova Disc Golf,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>A special edition series of Innova Models with a tackier, more durable plastic. Flight characteristics vary from the originals, but the discs maintain a long flight life. Used by 12-time World Champion Ken Climo. The Roc is simply the best, most versatile mid-range disc ever made. The Roc is a very predicable controlled midrange disc golf disc used for medium length shots with pin point accuracy. This golf disc can take and hold the angle of release, even into a headwind. It can be used for driving, upshots, straight shots, hyzer shots or anhyzers. If you're not sure what golf disc to throw, choose the Roc; just like most pros. We recommend this disc to players looking for one disc to play a round with. If you only carry one mid-range disc, make sure it's a Roc.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's KC Pro plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-4.gif"" alt=""speed-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-4.gif"" alt=""glide-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-3.gif"" alt=""fade-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Mid-range</li> <li>Diameter: 21.7cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Experienced players utility disc, hyzer shots, anhyzer shots</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",11.99,5.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,10.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Midrange;Disc Golf/Discs/Brand\/Model/Innova/Innova Roc,,,,,32984.0,a/611/1111-1a__63925.1559661305.1280.1280__04378.jpg,Innova KC PRO ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc - front view black with white stamp,Y,0.0,32981.0,o/590/1111-1b__38292.1559661305.1280.1280__84550.jpg,Innova KC PRO ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc - angled front view black with white stamp,N,1.0,32983.0,f/792/1111-1c__09756.1559661304.1280.1280__99455.jpg,Innova KC PRO ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc - angled back view black with white stamp,N,2.0,32982.0,u/815/1111-2a__27405.1559661706.1280.1280__89089.jpg,Innova KC PRO ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc - front view yellow with black stamp,N,3.0,32980.0,t/718/1111-3a__10085.1559661705.1280.1280__28386.jpg,Innova KC PRO ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc - front view white with blue stamp,N,4.0,32985.0,i/333/1111-4a__54905.1559661706.1280.1280__48997.jpg,Innova KC PRO ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc - front view blue with white stamp,N,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Innova KC Pro Roc Disc Golf Midrange - The Wright Life,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/stock-golf-discs/approach-discs/standard-plastic/innova-kc-pro-roc-disc-golf-approach-disc/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=4;Glide=4;Turn=0;Fade=3;""Plastic Class=Standard"""

Product,1003,Innova Tern (Star),P,ICD-39,,Innova Disc Golf,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The Tern has excellent speed and a flight path that maximizes glide over the entire flight. Like the name, this disc has natural turn. Similar to the Archon, the Tern is a fast slightly understable disc that is designed for long shot shaping throws.

We recommend this disc for players who like the Valkyrie but want more distance.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's DX plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-10.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-10.gif"" alt=""speed-10.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-2.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif"" alt=""fade-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Long Distance Drivers</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Turnover distance driver, tailwind driver, novice players looking for more distance</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",11.99,3.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,24.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Distance Driver;Disc Golf/Discs/Glow in the Dark,,,,,32812.0,v/648/5195-tl-1a__64332.jpg,Innova DX GLOW BEAST - Glow in the Dark Driver - front view,Y,0.0,32814.0,l/526/5195-tl-1b__73972.jpg,Innova DX GLOW BEAST - Glow in the Dark Driver - angled front view,N,1.0,32813.0,b/208/5195-tl-1c__80284.jpg,Innova DX GLOW BEAST - Glow in the Dark Driver - angled back view,N,2.0,32815.0,w/053/5195-tl-2a__87173.jpg,Innova DX GLOW BEAST - Glow in the Dark Driver - front view with red stamp,N,3.0,32865.0,g/334/5195-beast-1a3__45511.jpg,Innova DX GLOW BEAST - Glow in the Dark Driver - front view with red stamp glow,N,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/discs/distance-driver/innova-beast-glow-dx/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=10;Glide=5;Turn=-2;Fade=2;""Plastic Class=Basic"""

We recommend this disc to the player who want a faster more overstable version of the Eagle.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's GStar plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-9.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-9.gif"" alt=""speed-9.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-3.gif"" alt=""glide-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-4.gif"" alt=""fade-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Long Distance Drivers</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Headwind drives, flex shots, big hyzers</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",16.99,7.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,0.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Fairway Driver,,,,,15740.0,t/590/icd175GFBBlueWhiteTypeGStarFirebird-B__02390.jpg,INNOVA GSTAR FIREBIRD DISC GOLF DRIVER,N,0.0,15741.0,v/490/icd175GFBBlueWhiteTypeGStarFirebird__46000.jpg,INNOVA GSTAR FIREBIRD DISC GOLF DRIVER,Y,1.0,15742.0,c/878/icd175GFBBlueWhiteTypeGStarFirebird-C__41861.jpg,INNOVA GSTAR FIREBIRD DISC GOLF DRIVER,N,2.0,15737.0,a/978/icd175GRBRedBlueTypeGStarFireBird-B__54493.jpg,INNOVA GSTAR FIREBIRD DISC GOLF DRIVER,N,3.0,15738.0,v/131/icd175GRBRedBlueTypeGStarFireBird__86834.jpg,INNOVA GSTAR FIREBIRD DISC GOLF DRIVER,N,4.0,15739.0,k/465/icd175GRBRedBlueTypeGStarFireBird-C__43276.jpg,INNOVA GSTAR FIREBIRD DISC GOLF DRIVER,N,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"g-star, g star",,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/discs/fairway-driver/innova-firebird-gstar/,,,575,unisex,adult,,,,,ItemGroup1917,Disc Golf/Discs/Fairway Driver,N,,"Speed=9;Glide=3;Turn=0;Fade=4;""Plastic Class=Premium"""

We recommend this disc to players looking for their first fairway driver or a player looking to learn how to throw an anyhyzer.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Latitude 64 Frost Line plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-7.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-7.gif"" alt=""speed-7.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-7.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-7.gif"" alt=""glide-7.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-2.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-1.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-1.gif"" alt=""fade-1.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Fairway</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Turnovers, accurate drives, first anhyzer disc</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p> <p>Type a description for this product here...</p>",17.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,N,Y,,by option,1.0,0.0,Templates,,,,,8221.0,w/288/lat_frostRiver_fr__03511.jpg,LATITUDE 64 FROST RIVER DISC GOLF DRIVER,Y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/templates/latitude-64-frost-river-disc-golf-driver/,,,2158,,,,,,,,,N,,Speed=7;Glide=7;Turn=-2;Fade=1

This coupled with a delayed and focused fade make the Fireball a unique addition to the GYRO bag. It can function as a longer-pushing Motion, or a more overstable Tesla.

Average power throwers will get significant headwind resistance and see more easily workable lines than with the Motion. The Fireball is equally suited to backhands and forehands.

Product,2758,AXIOM PROTON INSANITY,P,AX-43INSANP,,Axiom,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The defining characteristic of the Insanity's flight is its slow turn and straight fade, crafted by design with softened shapes to mimic a worn Inertia. Thusly the Insanity needs less power to execute certain Inertia flights, and will exhibit a bit more turn and a noticeably more neutral fade portion than the Inertia. High power throwers will see enhanced glide and forward carry at low speeds, making it useful for a variety of low-ceiling shots and higher tailwind-riding lines. Average power throwers will see the most advantage with low height drives that gain distance and have enough stability to easily range. The Insanity is most suited to backhand drives, and either highly skilled forehands, or beginner-power forehands. Its high speed turn excels for hyzer-flip drives, turnovers, and smooth-power flat laserbeams, as well as a variety of utility and tailwind shots.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Axiom's Proton plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-9.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-9.gif"" alt=""speed-9.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-2.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-1.5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-1.5.gif"" alt=""fade-1.5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Distance Driver</li> <li>Diameter: 21.1cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Beginner driver, straight shots, shape shots</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",17.99,9.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,1.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Distance Driver,,,,,10448.0,z/273/ProtonInsanity__44777.jpg,AXIOM PROTON INSANITY DISTANCE DRIVER,Y,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Axiom Inspire brings an understable companion to the Axiom Crave.

Product,2847,Latitude 64 OPTO HEX RAKETEN  (OOP),P,DDS-206,,Latitude 64,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>Raketen (The Rocket in Swedish) is an extremely fast long distance driver due to the unique hexagon pattern. The HEX pattern helps the disc be less affected by air drag so it can fly faster, but at the same time you will lose a bit of the glide. This is quite easy to see when the disc touches the ground after a throw. It still has forward momentum and it is actually landing with more forward motion than a normal disc. Compared to Latitude 64's first HEX disc, Missilen, Raketen is easier to throw for slower arms and can be compared to their Bolt in stability. If you want to be the fastest guy on the course, pick up Raketen and start the countdown!</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Latitude 64 Opto Line plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-15.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-15.gif"" alt=""speed-15.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-4.gif"" src=""http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-4.gif"" alt=""glide-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-2.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-3.gif"" alt=""fade-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Driver</li> <li>Diameter: 21.4cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Max Distance, reliable distance driver, tailwinds</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",17.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,N,N,,none,0.0,0.0,Templates,,,,,10902.0,h/127/optohex__08064.jpg,,Y,0.0,10901.0,i/779/optohexedge__32008.jpg,,N,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/templates/latitude-64-opto-hex-raketen-driver-oop/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,Speed=15;Glide=4;Turn=-2;Fade=3

Average power throwers will get significant headwind resistance and see more easily workable lines than with the Motion. The Fireball is equally suited to backhands and forehands.

Thusly the Insanity needs less power to execute certain Inertia flights, and will exhibit a bit more turn and a noticeably more neutral fade portion than the Inertia. High power throwers will see enhanced glide and forward carry at low speeds, making it useful for a variety of low-ceiling shots and higher tailwind-riding lines. Average power throwers will see the most advantage with low height drives that gain distance and have enough stability to easily range. The Insanity is most suited to backhand drives, and either highly skilled forehands, or beginner-power forehands.

Like the name, this disc has natural turn. Similar to the Archon, the Tern is a fast slightly understable disc that is designed for long shot shaping throws. In the hands of a powerful player, it just may be one of the farthest flying discs due to the long glide and natural turn. Power throwers can throw it on a hyzer line, let it flip, and hook up at the end for serious distance.

Product,3247,Innova Roc3 (DX),P,ICD-155,,Innova Disc Golf,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The Roc3 is a fast, straight Roc that excels at controlled approaches and Mid-Range drives. The Roc3 holds a line in a variety of wind conditions and has a predictable fade, making this an ideal 'Go-To' Mid-Range in almost any situation. Advanced players will love the versatility of this disc while newer players can rely on the consistent finish. This is the same mold used in the 2012 USDGC Prototypes that were so highly received and were nearly impossible to keep in stock. This is the signature mold of the 2012 (and now 2013) World Champion Paul McBeth. We recommend this disc to the player that likes the normal Roc but wants a little more speed and better looks due to Innova's new Jolly Launcher plastic.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's DX plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-5.gif"" alt=""speed-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-4.gif"" alt=""glide-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-3.gif"" alt=""fade-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Mid-range</li> <li>Diameter: 21.7cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Control shots, go to mid-range, mid-range drives</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",8.99,7.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,6.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Midrange,,,,,15485.0,s/711/icd150R3OrangeWhiteTypeRoc3-B__49495.jpg,INNOVA DX ROC3 DISC GOLF MID-RANGE,N,0.0,15486.0,p/854/icd150R3OrangeWhiteTypeRoc3__93187.jpg,INNOVA DX ROC3 DISC GOLF MID-RANGE,Y,1.0,15487.0,s/051/icd150R3OrangeWhiteTypeRoc3-C__98631.jpg,INNOVA DX ROC3 DISC GOLF MID-RANGE,N,2.0,12744.0,a/719/icd_dxRoc3_b__89857.jpg,INNOVA DX ROC3 DISC GOLF MID-RANGE,N,3.0,15488.0,n/412/icd176R3BlueWhiteTypeRoc3-B__17904.jpg,INNOVA DX ROC3 DISC GOLF MID-RANGE,N,4.0,15489.0,m/258/icd176R3BlueWhiteTypeRoc3__66684.jpg,INNOVA DX ROC3 DISC GOLF MID-RANGE,N,5.0,15490.0,a/617/icd176R3BlueWhiteTypeRoc3-C__78104.jpg,INNOVA DX ROC3 DISC GOLF MID-RANGE,N,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/discs/midrange/innova-roc3-dx/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=5;Glide=4;Turn=0;Fade=3;""Plastic Class=Basic"""
Product,3263,INNOVA CHAMPION COLOSSUS,P,ICD-156,,Innova Disc Golf,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The Colossus disc golf driver is Innova's first foray into the Speed 14 world. A high-speed driver that can work for the masses, this disc stands tall above the rest. A close cousing to the Katana, the Colossus is recommended as a downwind driver or for long, bombing helix shots for maximum distance. The rim is still thick like other high-speed drivers, however it seems to feel a bit thinner than a Katana.

Targeted especially for pro-players the P2 works great for wrist-putts and fade-in shots inside and outside the circle.

This is your new go-to driver for versatility! According to Discraft: Most players have one versatile driver they reach for most often, and Undertaker is the new choice.

Product,3550,Millenium AQUARIUS (Floats),P,MIL-30,,Millennium,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The Millennium Standard Aquarius is a speed 10 understable long-range driver that floats in water. Designed to be beginner-friendly, it gives golfers confidence to clear long-range water hazards with control. It is made of an extra stiff and grippy Millennium plastic in weights 156-158. Low-power arms get increased distance due to its speed and high glide. More powerful arms will love the range it covers. When released level it has a long curved flight path. When released with a hyzer, it stands up and flies with a more stable line and fade finish. The Aquarius will out-drive other floating discs. In a tailwind, this disc can reach extreme distances. Put an Aquarius in your bag, and don't let a water hazard intimidate you from going long!</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Millennium Standard Plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-10.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-10.gif"" alt=""speed-10.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-4.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif"" alt=""fade-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Weight: assorted within 156-158g</li> <li>Classification: Long Range Driver</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Beginning driver, water holes, turnover shots</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",11.99,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,0.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Fairway Driver,,,,,35318.0,e/584/MIL-30-1a__93029.jpg,Millenium AQUARIUS Floating Disc Golf Driver Top View Yellow,Y,0.0,35317.0,v/045/MIL-30-1b__39176.jpg,Millenium AQUARIUS Floating Disc Golf Driver Angled Top View Yellow,N,1.0,35316.0,x/742/MIL-30-1c__15045.jpg,Millenium AQUARIUS Floating Disc Golf Driver Angled Bottom View Yellow,N,2.0,35319.0,a/105/MIL-30-4a__48823.jpg,Millenium AQUARIUS Floating Disc Golf Driver Top View Hot Pink,N,3.0,35321.0,i/649/MIL-30-3a__03010.jpg,,N,4.0,35320.0,y/239/MIL-30-2a__63932.jpg,Millenium AQUARIUS Floating Disc Golf Driver A Top View Orange,N,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf-stock-models/fairway-drivers/millenium-aquarius-floating-disc-golf-driver/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=6;Glide=4;Turn=-1;Fade=1;""Plastic Class=Standard"""

Product,3819,Innova CHAMPION SHRYKE,P,ICD-203,,Innova Disc Golf,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The Shryke has great speed profile and a flight path that maximizes distance by combining the helix shape along with maximum glide. A mild low-speed fade also lends itself to a long, slow finish which further extends distance. Great for long bombs for more powerful throwers or a good go-to distance driver for advanced players with medium arm-speed.

The Tern has excellent speed and a flight path that maximizes glide over the entire flight. Like the name, this disc has natural turn. Similar to the Archon, the Tern is a fast slightly understable disc that is designed for long, shot-shaping throws. In the hands of a powerful player, it just may be one of the farthest flying discs due to the long glide and natural turn. Power throwers can throw it on a hyzer line, let it flip, and hook up at the end for serious distance. We recommend this disc to the player that is looking to make the jump from a speed 9 or 10 disc to the ultra high speed 12 and 13 drivers.",,,,New,N,,N,,,0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/innova-champion-shryke-disc-golf-driver/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=13;Glide=6;Turn=-1;Fade=2;""Plastic Class=Candy"""

The blank top of the flight plate is perfect for doing your own custom artwork or stamping your club's graphic/logo!</p> <p>The Roc is simply the best, most versatile mid-range disc ever made.

Product,4107,Discmania TDX (S-Line),P,DM-70,,Discmania,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The Discmania TDx is an incredibly versatile disc in the fact that it offers easy, controllable distance while handling quite a bit of snap and power at the same time. While the Discmania TDx thrives with tailwind shots and anhyzer/turnovers thanks to its natural turn and glide, it can also be trusted to handle dead straight lines with a smooth fade at the end of every flight. The Discmania TDx has an amazing carry that will keep it in the air for a long time and it&rsquo;s remarkably easy to get comfortable with. You may not want to throw it into strong headwinds but other than that, this disc will be great for almost every shot you can imagine.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Discmania's S-Line plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-9.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-9.gif"" alt=""speed-9.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-3.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-1.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-1.gif"" alt=""fade-1.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Control Drivers</li> <li>Diameter: 21.1cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Flex shots, turnover shots, driver for wooded holes</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",16.99,8.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,0.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Distance Driver,,,,,32336.0,x/364/DM-70_TdxFR-3a__71769.jpg,DISCMANIA S-Line TDX DISC GOLF DRIVER Yellow Front View,Y,0.0,32333.0,k/126/DM-70_TdxFR-3b__95605.jpg,DISCMANIA S-Line TDX DISC GOLF DRIVER Yellow Angled Front View,N,1.0,32332.0,m/833/DM-70_TdxFR-3c__61573.jpg,DISCMANIA S-Line TDX DISC GOLF DRIVER Yellow Angled Back View,N,2.0,32334.0,q/121/DM-70_TdxFR-1a__42958.jpg,DISCMANIA S-Line TDX DISC GOLF DRIVER Orange Front View,N,3.0,32335.0,t/699/DM-70_TdxFR-2a__06197.jpg,DISCMANIA S-Line TDX DISC GOLF DRIVER Purple Front View,N,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/discs/distance-driver/discmania-tdx-s-line/,,,1021,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=9;Glide=5;Turn=-3;Fade=1;""Plastic Class=Premium"""

Discmania's most overstable midrange to date is a perfect fit for shots where the MD3 just won't quite cut it.</p> <p>Discmania says:</p> <p>The MD4 is the overstable brother of the MD3. It has a blunt nose with that standard MD3 micro-bead giving it a familiar feel in the hand. Not only is the MD4 overstable, but it also has a surprising amount of glide, allowing your shots to fade more while still maintaining predictability. We bet you&rsquo;ll love the low profile on these discs.</p> <p>Whether you&rsquo;re facing a stiff wind, looking for a controlled hyzer line, or throwing a nice touch sidearm, the MD4 has you covered.

Product,4678,Innova Rat (Star),P,ICD-306,,Innova Disc Golf,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>Players have asked for a forehand-specific approach disc and Innova has responded. Meet the Rat. It&rsquo;s a low-profile, beadless mid-range that flies fast out of the hand. Add the flat top and the Rat could be the most comfortable sidearm approach disc around. Rip it forehand and it&rsquo;ll fly straight with a predictable fade at the tail end. The backhand grip feels just as good with a flight just as predictable. Bonus: It&rsquo;s a good option for headwind approach shots.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's Star plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-4.gif"" alt=""speed-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-2.gif"" alt=""glide-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-3.gif"" alt=""fade-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Approach</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: headwind approaches, forehand shots</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",16.99,5.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,6.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Midrange,,,,,22416.0,d/428/ICD-306.green.a__79768.jpg,,Y,0.0,22413.0,f/036/ICD-306.green.c__33583.jpg,,N,1.0,22419.0,e/904/ICD-306.green.b__66344.jpg,,N,2.0,22417.0,s/800/ICD-306.yellow.a__36614.jpg,,N,3.0,22415.0,i/890/ICD-306.red.a__03024.jpg,,N,4.0,22414.0,j/744/ICD-306.pink.a__43314.jpg,,N,5.0,22418.0,f/471/ICD-306.lav.a__03204.jpg,,N,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/discs/midrange/innova-rat-star/,,,978,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=4;Glide=2;Turn=0;Fade=3;""Plastic Class=Premium"""

Product,5187,Innova Tern (Echo Star),P,859-ECHO_tern,,Innova Disc Golf,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The Tern has excellent speed and a flight path that maximizes glide over the entire flight. Like the name, this disc has natural turn. Similar to the Archon, the Tern is a fast slightly understable disc that is designed for long shot shaping throws. In the hands of a powerful player, it just may be one of the farthest flying discs due to the long glide and natural turn. Power throwers can throw it on a hyzer line, let it flip, and hook up at the end for serious distance.

Product,5490,INNOVA PRO SHRYKE,P,ICD-312,,Innova Disc Golf,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The Shryke has great speed profile and a flight path that maximizes distance by combining the helix shape along with maximum glide. A mild low-speed fade also lends itself to a long, slow finish which further extends distance. Great for long bombs for more powerful throwers or a good go-to distance driver for advanced players with medium arm-speed. Great glide and some high speed understability means this is also a good choice for downwind drives.

Product,5818,Axiom PLASMA FIREBALL,P,MVP-188,,Axiom,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The defining characteristic of the Fireball's flight is its wind and power resistance. This coupled with a delayed and focused fade make the Fireball a unique addition to the GYRO bag. It can function as a longer-pushing Motion, or a more overstable Tesla. High power throwers will get a fairly turn-free high speed stage that seems to hold a bit longer before fading, making the Fireball useful for long pan-outs, straight power shots, and sweeping hyzers. Average power throwers will get significant headwind resistance and see more easily workable lines than with the Motion. The Fireball is equally suited to backhands and forehands. Its high speed stability allows for line-locking power shots, and its late fade helps range the disc for optimal course placement.</p> <div class=""ProductDescriptionContainer prodAccordionContent"" style=""display: block;""> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Axiom Plasma Plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-9.gif"" src=""http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-9.gif"" alt=""speed-9.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-3.5.gif"" src=""http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-3.5.gif"" alt=""glide-3.5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-3.5.gif"" src=""http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-3.5.gif"" alt=""fade-3.5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Distance Driver</li> <li>Diameter: 21.1cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Forehand, Headwind shots, sweeping hyzers</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p> </div>",19.99,9.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,3.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Distance Driver,,,,,35107.0,t/608/MVP-188-1a__38681.jpg,Axiom PLASMA FIREBALL Driver Golf Disc Top View,Y,0.0,35108.0,f/336/MVP-188-1b__81697.jpg,Axiom PLASMA FIREBALL Driver Golf Disc Angled Top View,N,1.0,35105.0,a/490/MVP-188-1c__01917.jpg,Axiom PLASMA FIREBALL Driver Golf Disc Angled Bottom View,N,2.0,35106.0,s/893/MVP-188-2a__26401.jpg,Axiom PLASMA FIREBALL Driver Golf Disc Red Top View,N,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf-stock-models/distance-drivers/premium-plastic/axiom-plasma-fireball-driver-golf-disc/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=9;Glide=3.5;Turn=0;Fade=3.5;""Plastic Class=Premium"""

Pick your favorite color/weight from the dropdown menu. We will be updating the photo soon to reflect the new 5x design, but it is otherwise nearly identical to the existing photos.</p> <p>The new Discraft Undertaker offers players a dependably straight -- but not flippy -- distance driver that is very similar in feel and flight to the Stalker, just a couple notches faster. This is your new go-to driver for versatility! According to Discraft: Most players have one versatile driver they reach for most often, and Undertaker is the new choice. This straight flier fills many needs for many different skill levels: it doesn't get flippy for power throwers, isn't hard to control for low-power players.

Product,6032,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT *Pick One*,P,MIL-33_testFlight,,Discmania,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>First release, test version of the Falcon. Brand new and never thrown, condition 10/10.</p> <p>The peregrine Falcon, namesake of a star in the Aquila constellation, is known as the fastest animal on earth when doing its signature hunting dive. At speed 13, this Falcon is also extremely fast! This disc is an ultra-long-range driver that will carve up fairways long and wide. The <strong>Falcon</strong> is similar to our popular Scorpius but faster with slightly less high-speed stability. A solid turn will launch the <strong>Falcon</strong> into a ground-eating glide that, when paired with its aerodynamic wing give this disc outstanding distance. The low speed fade is reminiscent of the Scorpius which makes this disc&rsquo;s finish very dependable into all but the staunchest of headwinds.</p> <p><em>Please note: disc and stamp colors may vary from images shown.</em></p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Millennium's Sirius plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-13.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-13.gif"" alt=""speed-13.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-2.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif"" alt=""fade-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></p> <p><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Distance Drivers</li> <li>Best Choice for: Fast, maximum distance off the tee, huge turnovers</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",18.99,6.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,N,N,Ships in 1-2 Days,none,0.0,0.0,Templates,,,,,32203.0,b/854/MIL-33_testFlight-1a__60438.jpg,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT *Pick One* Driver Golf Disc Orange Front View,Y,0.0,32197.0,o/915/MIL-33_testFlight-1b__61779.jpg,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT *Pick One* Driver Golf Disc Orange Angled Front View,N,1.0,32199.0,b/537/MIL-33_testFlight-1c__32640.jpg,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT *Pick One* Driver Golf Disc Orange Angled Back View,N,2.0,32198.0,n/115/MIL-33_testFlight-3a__24107.jpg,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT *Pick One* Driver Golf Disc Yellow Front View,N,3.0,32200.0,m/861/MIL-33_testFlight-5a__77509.jpg,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT *Pick One* Driver Golf Disc Pink Front View,N,4.0,32201.0,r/222/MIL-33_testFlight-2a__80392.jpg,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT *Pick One* Driver Golf Disc White Front View,N,5.0,32202.0,x/912/MIL-33_testFlight-4a__24135.jpg,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT *Pick One* Driver Golf Disc Blue Front View,N,6.0,32329.0,c/331/mil_falcon-spread__83742.jpg,Millennium SIRIUS FALCON - TEST FLIGHT Driver Golf Disc - five colors spread out and overlapping on a table,N,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/templates/millennium-sirius-falcon-test-flight-pick-one-driver-golf-disc/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,Speed=13;Glide=5;Turn=-2;Fade=2

A combo of both the CD as well as the popular PD, this disc will fly a lot like that trusty PD you've had in the bag for a few months and broken in perfectly.

The Raider sits comfortably between the Trespass and Enforcer in stability, and it excels at finishing forward instead of diving at the end of its flight. Players with slower arm speeds will find a dependable, overstable driver that will gain them distance over the Enforcer or Defender, while faster arms will love the Raider as a workhorse driver that is perfect for carrying multiples to cover a variety of shots. Get ready to put some power on your distance shots, and watch the Raider destroy your previous best drives. </span></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-13.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-13.gif"" alt=""speed-13.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-.5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-.5.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-.5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-3.gif"" alt=""fade-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Distance Driver</li> <li>Best Choice for: Do everything driver, controlled distance</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",19.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,,by option,9.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Distance Driver,,,,,32910.0,t/146/DDS-947-1a__73064.jpg,Dynamic Discs Fuzion Raider Distance Driver Blue Front View,Y,0.0,32905.0,c/252/DDS-947-1b__54137.jpg,Dynamic Discs Fuzion Raider Distance Driver Blue Angled Front View,N,1.0,32906.0,d/632/DDS-947-1c__96622.jpg,Dynamic Discs Fuzion Raider Distance Driver Blue Angled Back View,N,2.0,32907.0,d/768/DDS-947-5a__91196.jpg,Dynamic Discs Fuzion Raider Distance Driver Orange Front View,N,3.0,32908.0,m/387/DDS-947-4a__04681.jpg,Dynamic Discs Fuzion Raider Distance Driver White Front View,N,4.0,32909.0,k/753/DDS-947-3a__88906.jpg,Dynamic Discs Fuzion Raider Distance Driver Pink Front View,N,5.0,32911.0,f/468/DDS-947-2a__07034.jpg,Dynamic Discs Fuzion Raider Distance Driver Red Front View,N,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/new-releases/dynamic-discs-fuzion-raider-distance-driver/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=13;Glide=5;Turn=-.5;Fade=3;""Plastic Class=Premium"""
Product,6116,Discmania P2 (P-Line),P,DM-6,,Discmania,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The P2 Psycho pro putter is significantly more stable than it's older brother the P1. Targeted especially for pro-players the P2 works great for wrist-putts and fade-in shots inside and outside the circle. Due to it's stability the P2 works great for approaches and can even tackle strong headwinds. It is also a very consistent driving putter. We recommend this putter to the players that likes the feel of Innova's normal no bead Aviar with the stability of the JK or KC Aviar. A true perfect blend of the two most popular putters in history.

Great collector disc or one to stock up on if you throw these earlier runs. Some of these have the disc identifier penned, others are embossed but all still have the patent numbers. All are brand new and never thrown, either 10/10 or 9/10 condition based on light storage wear.</p> <p>A special edition series of Innova Models with a tackier, more durable plastic. Flight characteristics vary from the originals, but the discs maintain a long flight life. Used by 12-time World Champion Ken Climo. The Roc is simply the best, most versatile mid-range disc ever made. The Roc is a very predicable controlled midrange disc golf disc used for medium length shots with pin point accuracy. This golf disc can take and hold the angle of release, even into a headwind. It can be used for driving, upshots, straight shots, hyzer shots or anhyzers. If you're not sure what golf disc to throw, choose the Roc; just like most pros. We recommend this disc to players looking for one disc to play a round with. If you only carry one mid-range disc, make sure it's a Roc.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's KC Pro plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-4.gif"" alt=""speed-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-4.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-4.gif"" alt=""glide-4.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-3.gif"" alt=""fade-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Mid-range</li> <li>Diameter: 21.7cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Experienced players utility disc, hyzer shots, anhyzer shots</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",16.99,5.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5000,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,15.0,0.0,"Disc Golf/Discs/Midrange;Disc Golf/Discs/Unique, PFN & OOP/Out of Production",,,,,32953.0,c/572/1111-2a__27405.jpg,Innova Pro KC ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc 180g w/ Patent #s Yellow Front View,Y,0.0,32951.0,j/009/1111-2b__59337.jpg,Innova Pro KC ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc 180g w/ Patent #s Yellow Angled Front View,N,1.0,32952.0,i/456/1111-2c__40879.jpg,Innova Pro KC ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc 180g w/ Patent #s Yellow Angled Back View,N,2.0,32950.0,b/713/1111-3a__10085.jpg,Innova Pro KC ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc 180g w/ Patent #s White Front View,N,3.0,32954.0,g/223/1111-4a__54905.jpg,Innova Pro KC ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc 180g w/ Patent #s Blue Front View,N,4.0,33406.0,j/672/1111-4a__59299.jpg,Innova Pro KC ROC Disc Golf Approach Disc 180g w/ Patent #s Black Front View,N,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf-stock-models/approach-discs/standard-plastic/innova-kc-pro-roc-w-patent-numbers-pick-one-oop/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=4;Glide=4;Turn=0;Fade=3;""Plastic Class=Standard"""

The Stabilizers defining flight characteristic is straight flights with minimal turn, into a strong finishing fade for point and shoot accuracy on the approach.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Streamline's plastics</a></p> <h3>Flight Characteristics</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-3.gif"" alt=""speed-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-3.5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-3.5.gif"" alt=""glide-3.5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-zero.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-zero.gif"" alt=""turn-zero.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-3.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-3.gif"" alt=""fade-3.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Putt and Approach</li> <li>Best Choice for: Straight-overstable drives, point and shoot approaches, headwind putts</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",13.99,7.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,5.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Putter & Approach,,,,,33478.0,l/973/MVP-207-1a__68153.jpg,Streamline NEUTRON STABILIZER Disc Golf Putter and Approach Green Top View,Y,0.0,33481.0,g/805/MVP-207-1b__84279.jpg,Streamline NEUTRON STABILIZER Disc Golf Putter and Approach Green Angled Top View,N,1.0,33477.0,b/360/MVP-207-1c__40648.jpg,Streamline NEUTRON STABILIZER Disc Golf Putter and Approach Green Angled Bottom View,N,2.0,33479.0,e/805/MVP-207-3a__61567.jpg,Streamline NEUTRON STABILIZER Disc Golf Putter and Approach Gray Top View,N,3.0,33480.0,s/449/MVP-207-2a__40758.jpg,Streamline NEUTRON STABILIZER Disc Golf Putter and Approach Orange Top View,N,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf-stock-models/putt-approach/premium-plastic/streamline-neutron-stabilizer-putter-and-approach/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=3;Glide=3.5;Turn=0;Fade=3;""Plastic Class=Premium"""

At speed 13, this Falcon is also extremely fast! This disc is an ultra-long-range driver that will carve up fairways long and wide. The <strong>Falcon</strong> is similar to our popular Scorpius but faster with slightly less high-speed stability. A solid turn will launch the <strong>Falcon</strong> into a ground-eating glide that, when paired with its aerodynamic wing give this disc outstanding distance.

Product,6313,Millennium QUANTUM DRACO,P,MIL-36,,Millennium,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>Named after the dragon constellation in the northern sky, Millennium&rsquo;s &ldquo;Draco&rdquo; is a mighty and overstable distance driver that fills a new space in the line. Similar in speed to our famous Orion LF, the Draco has less glide with a stronger and more sustained fade. Its combination of stability and speed give this disc a high degree of control and the power to fight headwinds for all skill levels and distance ranges.

Product,6514,Westside TOURNAMENT NORTHMAN,P,DDS-149,,Westside Discs,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>Westside Northman is one of our original drivers.

Product,6547,Evolution NEO ENIGMA,P,DM-133,,DGA,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>An enigma is defined as a thing that is mysterious, puzzling, or difficult to understand. This is the exact type of distance driver that you pull out of your bag, approach the teepad with confidence, throw a perfect drive with, and then have your playing partners instantly ask what you threw. The flight of the Enigma is really something and the results are head turning.</p> <p>If you&rsquo;ve thrown the Discmania DD3 and have loved it, you might find even more to love with the Enigma. Plus, if you&rsquo;ve found the DD3 to be a little too stable for you, the Enigma is exactly what you need.</p> <p>Once it gets up to speed the Enigma will show a little turn to help with the ultimate distance. This turn is specifically designed to give the disc as much room to fly as possible. It isn&rsquo;t overly &ldquo;flippy&rdquo; though. You can really control this disc with the power behind it and the release angle.</p> <p>As the Enigma continues down the fairway, the fade will bring it back toward center, but with a very forward penetrating fade. It will return for you, but it will with distance at the front of its mind. Quite simply, this disc can really fly.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Discmania Evolution NEO Plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-12.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-12.gif"" alt=""speed-12.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-5.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-5.gif"" alt=""glide-5.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-1.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-1.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-1.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif"" alt=""fade-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Driver</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: First big distance driver, sidearm drives, consistent driver</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",19.99,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,6.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Distance Driver;Disc Golf/New Releases,,,,,36201.0,y/751/DM-133-1a__74751.jpg,Evolution NEO ENIGMA Driver Blue Top View,Y,0.0,36202.0,z/960/DM-133-1b__73191.jpg,Evolution NEO ENIGMA Driver Blue Angled Top View,N,1.0,36203.0,m/284/DM-133-1c__75331.jpg,Evolution NEO ENIGMA Driver Blue Angled Bottom View,N,2.0,36204.0,i/244/DM-133-4a__64221.jpg,Evolution NEO ENIGMA Driver Pink Top View,N,3.0,36205.0,a/294/DM-133-3a__52861.jpg,Evolution NEO ENIGMA Driver White Top View,N,4.0,36206.0,v/744/DM-133-2a__88717.jpg,Evolution NEO ENIGMA Driver Yellow Top View,N,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,5.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf-stock-models/distance-drivers/candy-plastic/evolution-neo-enigma-driver/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=12;Glide=5;Turn=-1;Fade=2;""Plastic Class=Candy"""

Product,6836,Dynamic Discs Lucid Raider,P,DDS-345,,Dynamic Discs,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p><span id=""product_description"">The Raider is sure to steal its spot in bags of all skill levels. The Raider sits comfortably between the Trespass and Enforcer in stability, and it excels at finishing forward instead of diving at the end of its flight. Players with slower arm speeds will find a dependable, overstable driver that will gain them distance over the Enforcer or Defender, while faster arms will love the Raider as a workhorse driver that is perfect for carrying multiples to cover a variety of shots.

Product,7399,Axiom Insanity (Plasma),P,MVP-94,,Axiom,Disc Golf - Stock Models,Right,"<p>The defining characteristic of the Insanity's flight is its slow turn and straight fade, crafted by design with softened shapes to mimic a worn Inertia. Thusly the Insanity needs less power to execute certain Inertia flights, and will exhibit a bit more turn and a noticeably more neutral fade portion than the Inertia. High power throwers will see enhanced glide and forward carry at low speeds, making it useful for a variety of low-ceiling shots and higher tailwind-riding lines. Average power throwers will see the most advantage with low height drives that gain distance and have enough stability to easily range. The Insanity is most suited to backhand drives, and either highly skilled forehands, or beginner-power forehands.

Let&rsquo;s compare it to something you&rsquo;re all familiar with, shall we? The closest relative to the Essence as it stands now is the TD2 from the Originals line. We&rsquo;ve repurposed, reimagined, and reinvented our goals for an understable fairway driver and have done exactly that. Given the understable nature of the Essence, this disc is best suited for players looking for their first distance driver, backhand or smooth forehand throws, tailwinds, and excellent roller shots. Although beginner and novice throwers are recommended, we expect many pros out there will take a liking to this disc quickly. The rounded semi-blunt nose of the disc allows for fantastic roller shots and controlled backhand or forehand throws when you need it most.

We recommend this disc to players looking for a fairway driver that falls between the Innova Teebird and Leopard.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Discmania's S-line plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-7.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-7.gif"" alt=""speed-7.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-6.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-6.gif"" alt=""glide-6.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-1.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-1.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-1.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-1.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-1.gif"" alt=""fade-1.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Fairway</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Long turnovers, tailwind drives, tight fairways</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",19.99,8.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,2.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Fairway Driver,,,,,43193.0,b/729/DSC04684__41656.JPG,Discmania FD (S-Line) Grateful Disc 2020 White Top View,Y,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New,N,,N,,,0.0,Default Tax Class,,N,/disc-golf/discs/fairway-driver/discmania-fd-s-line-grateful-disc-2020/,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,"Speed=7;Glide=6;Turn=-1;Fade=1;""Plastic Class=Premium"""

Great glide and some high speed understability means this is also a good choice for downwind drives. Compare the Shryke to the popular Tern but with more speed and a bit less high-speed turn.</p> <p>The 2020 Shryke has a slightly slower Speed number; 12 instead of 13.</p> <p>Information about <a title=""Information about this plastic type"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/plastic-types-and-descriptions/"">Innova's GStar plastic</a></p> <h3>FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS</h3> <div><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""speed-12.gif"" src=""https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/speed-12.gif"" alt=""speed-12.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""glide-6.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/glide-6.gif"" alt=""glide-6.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /></div> <p><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""turn-minus-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/turn-minus-2.gif"" alt=""turn-minus-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><img class=""__mce_add_custom__"" title=""fade-2.gif"" src=""https://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server100/yt68tfv9/product_images/uploaded_images/fade-2.gif"" alt=""fade-2.gif"" width=""70"" height=""62"" /><br /><a title=""About the flight characteristics numbering system"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/flight-bar-details/"">(What is this?)</a></p> <h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3> <ul> <li>Classification: Long Distance Drivers</li> <li>Diameter: 21.2cm</li> <li>Best Choice for: Versatile distance driver, great glide, downwind driver</li> </ul> <h3>More Information</h3> <p><a title=""Wright Life staff picks"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/staff-picks/"">See what the Wright Life staff have in their bag</a></p> <p><a title=""Learn why discs fly the way they do"" href=""https://www.wrightlife.com/the-nature-of-flight/"">Learn about the ""Nature of Disc Flight""</a></p>",16.99,8.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,N,,0.5,8.25,0.5,8.25,Y,Y,Ships in 1-2 Days,by option,2.0,0.0,Disc Golf/Discs/Distance Driver,,,,,43370.0,e/103/DSC05332__98383.JPG,Innova Shryke (GStar) 2020 Green Top View,Y,0.0,43371.0,a/564/DSC05329__01240.JPG,Innova Shryke (GStar) 2020 Blue Top View,N,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"g-star, g star",,,"Get your grip on!

The Tern has excellent speed and a flight path that maximizes glide over the entire flight. Like the name, this disc has natural turn. Similar to the Archon, the Tern is a fast slightly understable disc that is designed for long, shot-shaping throws. In the hands of a powerful player, it just may be one of the farthest flying discs due to the long glide and natural turn. Power throwers can throw it on a hyzer line, let it flip, and hook up at the end for serious distance.
